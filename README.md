# Maps Repository

## Overview

Welcome to the **Maps Repository**! This repository showcases various maps created as part of my student project. The project focuses on applying Geographic Information Systems (GIS) techniques to perform spatial analysis, visualize data, and use Remote Sensing and CAD tools to produce suitability analysis of a basil crop in kiambu county.

## Project Description

In this project, I have explored different aspects of GIS and Remote Sensing to analyze geographical data and create a range of maps. These maps illustrate different types of geographical phenomena and data visualizations, from elevation and slope analysis to land use classifications and precipitation patterns.

## Skills Exhibited

During this project, I developed and demonstrated the following skills:

- **GIS Analysis**: Applied spatial analysis techniques to interpret and manipulate geographical data.
- **Data Visualization**: Created various types of maps to visually represent data and convey information effectively.
- **Remote Sensing**: Utilized satellite imagery and remote sensing techniques to gather and classify land use data.
- **CAD Tools**: Employed QGIS, and ARCMAP tools for advanced mapping and spatial analysis tasks.
